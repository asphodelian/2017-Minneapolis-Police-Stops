# Overview
Welcome to Gabrielle Salamanca's Math 748 project for Fall 2024. This is a graduate project exploring the dateset MplsStops taken from [Vincent Arel Bundock's Github](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html
). The specific documentation of this dataset can be found [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/MplsStops.html). 

## Project Description
There can be multiple reasons why a police officer may stop someone on the road: a
traffic violation, the possibility of being part of a crime, a warning about a situation, etc. In this
project, my objective is to find out if there’s some sort of pattern for those who were stopped, if
there’s any common characteristics on whether or not someone received a citiaton. And it can be
furthered to questions like: was there a higher percentage of a certain race being stopped, being
given a citation; do certain police precincts or neighborhoods have a significant amount of
incidents?
